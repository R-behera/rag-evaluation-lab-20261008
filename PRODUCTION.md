# Production Design

This document defines how to take the dependency-free baseline toward a
portfolio-quality production implementation. The goal is to demonstrate the
engineering around an AI model, not merely wrap a hosted inference API.

## Real-World Data Sources

| Source | Purpose | Endpoint |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GitHub REST API | Real technical questions for evaluation-set construction | `https://api.github.com/repos/huggingface/transformers/issues?state=open&per_page=5` |
| arXiv API | Public RAG literature for grounded-answer cases | `https://export.arxiv.org/api/query?search_query=all:retrieval%20augmented%20generation&start=0&max_results=5` |

Use `python -m rag_evaluation.real_world` to fetch a small raw
snapshot. Review API terms, data licenses, rate limits, privacy, and retention
before building a durable ingestion job.

## Service Boundaries

- **Ingestion:** resumable API clients, raw snapshots, schema validation, and
  dead-letter handling.
- **Index/training:** versioned transformations, deterministic splits, and
  artifact lineage.
- **Online inference:** typed requests, confidence thresholds, evidence, and
  human review.
- **Evaluation:** offline golden sets, adversarial cases, release thresholds,
  and production feedback.
- **Observability:** OpenTelemetry traces, latency and cost metrics, model and
  prompt versions, and privacy-safe logs.

## Scaling Targets

- Detect 100% of seeded unsupported-answer regressions
- Track retrieval, faithfulness, citation, latency, and cost metrics
- Fail CI when any critical metric drops beyond tolerance
- Produce comparable evaluation reports for every model version

## Data and Model Versioning

Store the source snapshot ID, transformation commit, dataset version, model
version, evaluation report, and deployment SHA together. A release is eligible
only when its evaluation thresholds pass in CI.

## Reliability

- Make ingestion and tool calls idempotent.
- Retry transient failures with bounded exponential backoff.
- Persist workflow state before external side effects.
- Add circuit breakers around remote APIs and model providers.
- Preserve the last known-good index and model for rollback.

## Security

- Use least-privilege credentials and secret managers.
- Enforce authorization before retrieval or tool execution.
- Redact sensitive fields before traces and logs.
- Validate uploaded documents and isolate parsing workloads.
- Require human approval for consequential state changes.
